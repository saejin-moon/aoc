# blog of saejin's crash-outs over aoc
epic. over-dramatic. the whole shebang. for me to laugh at next year when i come back to this.
## 2015
### day 1 (6m, dec 2 25)
done while on call with dom. just some native array methods.
### day 2 (6m, dec 2 25)
done on the same call with dom as day 1. wicked simple math.
### day 3 (8m, dec 2 25)
same call as d1, d2 y15. there's def a better way to do this. stringifying into a set is bizarre. but it works and idrc.
### day 4 (2m, dec 2 25)
spent more time installing md5 library than coding.
### day 5 (10m, dec 2 25)
hehehe stole dom's regex.
## 2025
### day 1 (25m, dec 1 25)
wicked simple. should've been faster but i forgot that `> 99` needed to be counted to since the pointer goes to zero.
### day 2 (20m, dec 2 25)
string mush. optimized it post-completion.
### day 3 (121m, dec 3 25)
not proud of part 2. part 1 is so ugly beautiful with its insane array manipulation. part 2 is just pure brute force. try removing one digit every possible way keeping track of which digit removal gave us the highest value and then repeating until the number is twelve digits.
### day 4 (30m, dec 4 25)
would've been faster but read-only manipulation (bro why is this even a thing in javascript the language of why-not-coerce-anything-into-anything) for the string array plus not being able to access individual characters into a string to modify is always ugh. pretty proud of how fast i got the solution nonetheless.
